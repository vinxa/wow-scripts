# misc wow scripts
This is a collection of scripts I've made for wow.

## structure
`google_sheets_scripts` contains .gs files for google apps script. note as all other .gs files in an apps script project share a global namespace, some functions are shared.
`wcl_queries` contains snippets for warcraftlogs
`discord_loot_bot` contains the source code for beijbot's integration with google sheets loot wishlists

## other
`metaAchievementProgress.py` is a python script you can run on your pc. it will recursively find all the required achievements for an overarching meta achievement and display it on a html page. I will convert this to a proper webpage at some point.
